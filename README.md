# CMS Application Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation outlines the functionality and structure of a Content Management System (CMS) application with integrated quiz and news features. The application is built with Express, a web application framework for Node.js, and uses MongoDB as its database for storing and processing data.

## System Architecture

### Frontend

- **Features** :
- Four main tabs: Home, Quiz, News, and Admin.
- The Quiz tab allows users to participate in a quiz with four answer options.
- The News tab displays the latest news entries.

### Backend

- **Technologies** : Express framework with Node.js
- **Database** : MongoDB
- Features:
  1. Collects and stores quiz answers in MongoDB and counts the votes.
  2. Displays the results of the quiz, showing the number of votes for each answer.
  3. Manages news entries where admins can create and edit news posts.

### Database

- **Management System** : MongoDB
- **Collections** :
- Quiz answers with vote counts.
- News articles with details for display.
- Admin credentials for secure login.

## Application Setup

### Prerequisites

- Installed Node.js and npm.
- Installed MongoDB and running on the local machine or accessible via the network.
- Installed Git for cloning the project repository (if applicable).

### Installation and Configuration

- Clone the project repository (if applicable).
- Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run `npm install` to install all necessary node modules.
- Configure MongoDB connection strings and admin credentials in the application's configuration files.
- Set up environment variables for sensitive data such as database URI and admin credentials.

## Running the Application

- Use the command `npm start` to run the Express server.
- Access the application through the web browser at `http://localhost:[PORT]`, where `[PORT]` is the port number specified in the configuration.

## Usage

### Participating in the Quiz

- Users navigate to the Quiz tab.
- They select an answer for the quiz question and submit their vote.
- The application sends the data to MongoDB, where the vote is recorded.

### Viewing Quiz Results

- After voting, users can see the results displayed with the number of votes for each answer.

### Managing News

- Admins navigate to the Admin tab and log in with their credentials.
- Once authenticated, admins can post new news articles or edit existing ones.
- The changes are immediately reflected in the News tab for all users.

## Security Considerations

- Admin login credentials are stored securely and should not be included in the source code.
- # Ensure that communication with the database is secured and that proper validation checks are in place to prevent injection attacks.
